# Mozilla_Club_Technical_Interviews
This github repository has been set to test the Technical skills of the Candidates.

Hello, My name is Swaralee . I'm from SY Comp. I'm a passionate aspiring student of software development, always eager to explore how technology can solve real-world problems. My primary interests lie in data structures and algorithms for efficient problem-solving, and I also enjoy delving into web development especially the UI part of the website. I love to create attractive and intuitive interfaces for better user experience. I'm particularly keen to join the Mozilla Club because I strongly believe in its open-source ethos and dedication to empowering the web, which perfectly aligns with my own desire to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
